# Sound Files Placeholder

This directory should contain:
- `correct.mp3` - Sound effect for correct answers
- `incorrect.mp3` - Sound effect for incorrect answers

## Obtaining Sound Files

You can:
1. Generate simple beep sounds using online tools (e.g., https://freesound.org/)
2. Use text-to-speech to create simple "correct" / "incorrect" audio
3. Purchase royalty-free sound effects from audio libraries

## Expected Format
- Format: MP3
- Duration: 0.5-1 second
- Volume: normalized to prevent distortion
- License: Permissive (CC0 or similar)

For now, the application will work without these files - the audio will simply not play.
